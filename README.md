# Spongy!

Movement Prototype

You are the sentient sponge of Moonbase Omega. Explore the plumbing. Keep the water running. Don't get jammed up yourself!

Use the mouse to aim your jump. Press space to jump.

Mini-Postmortem:

What I like:
* Movement is fun
* You stick to stuff

What I wish had gone better:
* I spent all of my polish time goofing around with squishy physics that never made it into the game
* The theme is nowhere to be seen
* Movement is the ONLY mechanic
  * What if you could get squeezed back out after you swell up?
  * What if movement changed based on what you had soaked up?
